# HTML to PDF Signer Fastify REST API

This project provides a complete solution for converting HTML content to PDF and digitally signing the generated PDFs. It consists of a backend REST API built with Fastify (with some components using NestJS for testing) and a frontend web application for user interaction.

## Features

- Convert HTML to PDF
- Digitally sign PDFs asynchronously
- RESTful API for backend operations
- Web UI for uploading content and managing jobs
- Asynchronous job processing with BullMQ and Redis
- Error handling and validation

## Architecture

### Overview
The system is divided into two main components: the backend API and the frontend application.

- **Backend**: Handles API requests, job queuing, and PDF processing.
- **Frontend**: Provides a user interface for interacting with the backend.

### Backend Architecture
- Built with Node.js and Fastify.
- Uses BullMQ for job queuing with Redis.
- Processes HTML to PDF conversion and digital signing.

### Frontend Architecture
- Web application built with [React/Vue/Angular].
- Communicates with the backend API.
- Handles user uploads, job status, and downloads.

### Data Flow
1. User uploads HTML via frontend.
2. Frontend sends request to backend API.
3. Backend enqueues job for processing.
4. Worker processes the job: converts HTML to PDF, signs it.
5. User can check status and download the signed PDF.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js
- Redis
- npm or yarn

### Backend Setup
1. Navigate to `backend/`: `cd backend`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Configure environment variables (Redis, certificates).
4. Run: `npm run dev`

### Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to `frontend/`: `cd frontend`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Configure API URL.
4. Run: `npm run dev`

## Usage

- Start both backend and frontend.
- Access the frontend in a browser.
- Upload HTML content to generate and sign PDFs.

## Testing

- Backend: `cd backend && npm test`
- Frontend: `cd frontend && npm test`
